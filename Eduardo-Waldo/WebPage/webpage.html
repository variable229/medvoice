	<p style="font-family:arial narrow;"> I received my B.A. in Political Science and B.S. in Mathematics from Chapman University.
	As an undergraduate, I worked closely with faculty in order to acquire a deeper understanding of Real and Complex Analysis
	. I also dedicated my final coursework in Political Science attempting to answer the question of why immigration reform failed to progress in American Politics
	</p>

	<p style="font-family:arial narrow;">I possess a keen desire to learn from different spheres of academia.
		Currently, I am pursuing Graduate Studies in Data Science at Chapman University.
