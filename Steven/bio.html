<h1>Bio</h1>

<p>
	My name is Steven Widelitz and I am a junior mechanical engineering student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. As a child, I was in love with trains and all things train related; my living room was filled with Thomas the Train track, then Lionel track when I got a bit older. This interest eventually shifted a bit to cars and the automotive industry, causing me to want to work in this industry. My goals to develop at Medvoice are a background in software that will allow me to work on in-car apps, and connected car technologies.
