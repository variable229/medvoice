                        <h3>Device Info</h3>
                        <p>We collect your information to present you with information that is pertinent to you. When you activate a device, we ask for information like height and weight to personalize your stats. When you use it, we collect data like number of steps you take or your BMI to show your stats and progress. And when you sync, we collect data like sync time and battery level, to help you keep your tracker (and yourself) up and running.</p>

                        <h3>IP Address</h3>
                        <p>Upon accessing our website, information such as your IP address is automatically collected to ensure that you are receiving the most relevant information pertaining to you and your locale.</p>

                        <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>Our policy on cookies—in life, and online—is that we like them a lot, in moderation. When you visit our site, we use cookies and other technologies to improve what we do and how we do it. More details in our <a href="#">Cookie Policy</a> will be provided upon request.</p>

                        <h3>Friends</h3>
                        <p>When you add friends to your MedVoice account by email, we’ll use the contact information you provide to send them an invitation to join you on MedVoice. But we promise not to add them to a marketing list or use their email after that.</p>

                        <h3>GPS and Location</h3>
                        <p>Some features, like run mapping, require us to collect location data like GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. But we’ll only collect that data when you’re using those features.</p>

                        <p>Everything’s better when it’s tailored to you. That’s why we save info like your email and date of birth when you make a MedVoice account. And why, when you create a profile description, set your time zone, upload a profile picture or add information to customize your experience, we store that information in your account.</p>

                        <h3>Your Contact Info</h3>
                        <p>We’ve tried, but we just can’t get the psychic thing down. So, when you contact us for help, we collect your name, email, and the details of your request to make sure we get you the answers you need.</p>

                        <h3>Purchase Details</h3>
                        <p>When you buy a health report, we use your credit card information to process your purchase.  We will also collect information such as your name, billing information, and billing address to complete the transaction.  </p>

                        <h3>Social Media</h3>
                        <p>Let you use Facebook or Google+ to create your account, or if you connect your MedVoice account with those accounts, we’ll ask for permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name, profile picture, and friend list.</p>

                        <h3>Privacy of Children</h3>
                        <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from any users under the age of 13.  We will remove any personal information from MedVoice from any child under 13.  If you have reasons to believe that we may have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at at <a href="mailto:info@medvoicebio.com">info@medvoicebio.com</a> </p>

                        <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
                        <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, users who are California residents may request and receive once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we disclosed personal information for direct marketing purposes.  If you wish to make a request, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@medvoicebio.com">info@medvoicebio.com</a> or mail us at 10810 Warner Avenue, Fountain Valley, CA 92708 </p>

                        <p>We use de-identified data (data that does not identify you personally) to share general information about people’s activities. For example, we might create an infographic about popular summer workouts to use in a new marketing email.</p>
