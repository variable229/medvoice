    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Holly.  I've lived in Orange County for most of my life.  I received my Bachelor's from UCI and I went back to school to get a graduate degree. I'm currently a student at California State University of Fullerton.
        I am working on my Master's in Software Engineering. The two languages that I am most familar with are C++ and Java.
        I got into this field because I thought building my own application would be interesting.
        Also, the tech field is constantly evolving so there are always new things to learn. Some of my hobbies are reading, hiking, and camping.</p>
